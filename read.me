This is to solve the zebra and (eventually) the einstein logic
puzzles.  In R, type source("zebra.R") and this will create file
"zebra.cnf" which is in conjugate normal form (CNF).

The numbers in zebra.cnf correspond to the various logical statements.

To solve the puzzle, use any cnf solver.  I have been working with
glucose or glucose-syrup (simp).  Then './glucose zebra.cnf' solves
the puzzle in the sense of establishing whether the constraints are
consistent or not, and './glucose -model zebra.cnf' provides an
instantiation.

./glucose -model zebra.cnf | tail -1 > zebra_solution.txt

creates text file zebra_solution.txt which specifies the solution.  Then
